This project is part of a Javascript tutorial in a RPG format.
Here we'll be building a bot that checks a character's attributes on Habitica and report its status on Twitter.
Initially the idea was to make a cron bot that would publish these reports daily, but I had problems with both Heroku and Now and decided to continue this tutorial with Docker and AWS later. For now, we'll be serving a GET endpoint which once accessed, it will trigger the report and display a feedback.

Check the [commit history](https://github.com/Markkop/habiticaStatusReporter/commits/master) for a step-by-step guide.
